# Exercism Solutions

Welcome! This is a personal collection of my solutions to programming exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). If you’ve stumbled in here, feel free to browse, learn, or laugh at my code.

## Structure

- Solutions are grouped by language and exercise.
- Each folder contains my code, and sometimes notes.
